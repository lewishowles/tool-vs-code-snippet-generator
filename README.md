# Snippet generator for Visual Studio Code

This tool provides a quick and consistent way to generate new VSCode snippets from a block of code, which can be pasted into one of the appropriate snippet JSON files.

To generate a complete snippet, we need three pieces of information:

1. The title of the snippet, which identifies it in a list
2. The prefix for a snippet, which defines how it will be invoked
3. The code that will become the body of the snippet.
